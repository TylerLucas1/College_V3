##  Views

The database includes several custom **SQL views** to simplify querying and reporting across core entities like students, instructors, courses, and academic performance. These views were created to answer common questions and support administrative tasks.

###  Implemented Views

| View Name                        | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sections_with_rooms_view`      | Displays which instructors are teaching which courses, in which rooms, and at what times. Includes course name, room details, and instructor info. |
| `graduated_students_high_gpa_view` | Lists all students who have **graduated** with a **GPA above 3.5**, including their admission/graduation dates and GPA. |
| `instructor_by_role_view`       | Shows employees with their assigned role titles, security levels, and personal details. Helps identify faculty/staff structure. |
| `semesters_by_student_view`     | Lists all semesters each student has been enrolled in, including enrollment status (e.g., Active, Completed, Withdrawn). Useful for tracking student progress over time. |

> These views were built using `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY` clauses, and tested on sample data generated using `INSERT` statements.  
> They are reusable across reporting tools or integrations with front-end dashboards.
